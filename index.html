    <p class="post-para-6">A process called pyrolysis can recycle plastic waste in the abscence of oxygen to produce gasoline. There are three types pf pyrolysis: slow, flash and fast. An 8.3 pounds of plastic can produce one gallon of fuel. A super glue can be made from gasoline and styrofoam. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZP5Ryd898c">(super glue) </a>The later is dangerous to be set in fire. SO BE CAREFUL!! Video clip shows the steps to make pyrolysis in a simple method.</p>

    <img class="p-7" src="images/sheep-lawn.jpg" alt="Sheep grazing on turf lawn">
    <p class="post-para-7">Would it be nice to have a flock of sheep grazing turf grass instead of lawn mowers? A specialized company in Fairfax called <a href="https://www.lambmowers.com/">Lamb Mowers</a> offeres such ecological services. Instead of charging per hour, the cost will be $275 on weekends and evenings. The benefits are tremendous. Sheep's poop are low odor 
      and biogradable fertilizer. As per the ordinance of the city, sheep should be kept on a minimum area of 2 acres. <br>
